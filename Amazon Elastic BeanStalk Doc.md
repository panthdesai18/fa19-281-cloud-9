## Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Documentation:

* I have used Amazon's Elastic BeanStalk to deploy my login and location backend.

### Refrence Link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/Welcome.html

### Below are the steps for BeanStalk deployment:

* #### Login into your AWS account:

    Open BeanStalk console

* #### Create an Application and an Environment:

    for Platform, choose a platform, and then choose Create application
      
* #### Creates an Elastic Beanstalk application:

      Launches an environment named GettingStartedApp-env with these AWS resources:
        An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance (virtual machine)
        An Amazon EC2 security group
        An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket
        Amazon CloudWatch alarms
        An AWS CloudFormation stack
        A domain name

* #### Creates a new application version named Sample Application. This is the default Elastic Beanstalk example application file.
      
* #### Deploys the code for the example application to the GettingStartedApp-env environment.
